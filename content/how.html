    <h1>How does an electric guitar work?</h1>
    <body>
    <p>Part of the beauty of the electric guitar is its timeless design. The core electronic design of the electric guitar has essentially remained unchanged since its inception (most modern electric guitars operate in much the same way as the Rickenbacker "Frying Pan" - one of the first commercially available electric guitars). The Fender Stratocaster (Even if you don't know the name, you've definitely seen and heard one of these before - they're everywhere) is still more or less based off the exact design it was born with in 1954 which made it the most popular (and most copied) guitar in the world. </p>

        <p>This is the case because it simply just works. The design itself has never been insufficient - the simple electronics also make it very well suited to mass production, and allow the owner to repair and modify the guitar's circuitry with little more than a soldering iron. In terms of operation, the method is equally as simple.
        <ul>
        <li>The vibration of the strings on the guitar is picked up by (the aptly named) pickups, which are simply several pole magnets with copper wire wrapped around them (often several thousand times).</li>
        <li>These magnets generate a magnetic field, and as the vibration of the strings disturbs the magnetic field, these vibrations are converted into an electrical signal and sent through the guitars circuitry to an amplifier.</li>
        <li>Along the way, several analog controls built into the guitar may alter the sound if they are present (potentiometers which control the flow of the guitars signal using resitance, which can change the volume and frequencies the guitar emits).</li>
        <li>The amplifier then takes the guitars raw signal and amplifies to to audible levels.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>At its simplest, this is the same design the electric guitar has used since its inception. Obviously, the sound of the electric guitar has evolved, with sounds ranging from overdrive pedals which add dirt and distortion to the sound, to octaver pedals which make the instrument sound eerie and robotic. However, these pedals still take the guitar's raw signal and alter it - the same signal which electric guitars have been putting out since the 1930's.</p>
