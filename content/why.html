    <h1>Why was a louder guitar necessary?</h1>
    <body>
        <p>In the early 1900s as dance halls and musical performances became more popular among increasingly larger audiences, the demand for even louder instruments grew, in particular the guitar. In a typical dance hall environment, the small flattop guitars of the time were very frequently drowned out by larger wind and brass instruments. Many guitar manufacturers attempted to remedy this by making ever-larger guitars and experimenting with new materials. (A notable example is the Dobro resonator guitar, which used metal cones inside to project sound farther and at greater volumes.) </p>

        <p>Eventually, for many guitar manufacturers it was no longer feasible to continue attempting to make their guitars louder in this way. Dobros, although louder, had a very different sound to a normal acoustic guitar, and normal acoustics had already reached a rather large size (Martin's "Dreadnought" models are a good example.) Consequently, in the years to follow many guitar manufacturers began to turn to electricity as the next logical step in the amplification of the guitar.</p>
