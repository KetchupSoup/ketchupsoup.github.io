    <h1>Notable Figures in Electric Guitar Design</h1>
    <body>
        <p>Throughout the electric guitar's history, many contributed to it's design and development. This page lists some of the most notable individuals.</p>
        <h2>Adolph Rickenbacker </h2>

        <p>Adolph Rickenbacker was a Swiss-American inventor credited for being the "Father of the Electric Guitar". He was largely responsible for the creation of the "Frying Pan" guitar (along with guitarist George Beauchamp), one of the first commercially available electric guitars, released under his namesake. However, before he made history with the frying pan, he also machined parts for the National Guitar Company (inventors of the Dobro resonator, which has been mentioned <a href="content/why.html">here.</a>) Beauchamp first thought of the idea of using magnets to create an amplified guitar, and it was Rickenbacker himself that financed and produced this guitar. The "Frying Pan" itself had troubled beginnings. Sales were going nowhere, and several amplifier related design flaws had caused many musicians to develop disdain toward Rickenbacker's guitar, which many were skeptical about in the first place. However, as sales slowly began to pick up and public recognition of the instrument increased, business began to boom. Before this, Rickenbacker was close to giving up, and if not for his perseverance, the electric guitar may never have become the staple instrument it is now. </p>
        <h2>Leo Fender</h2>

        <p>Leo Fender was responsible for the creation of the Fender Musical Instruments Corporation. Fender was directly involved in the creation of some of the world's most popular and recognisable guitars such as the Stratocaster, Telecaster and Jaguar. Before Fender revolutionised guitar design with his Telecaster in 1951, most electric guitars of the time were large, bulky hollw-bodied guitars which were expensive and time consuming to manufacture. Fender noticed that he could streamline the process of manufacturing a guitar in a factory, allowing for lower costs and quicker manufacture, by making the guitar a solid body, rather than hollow. It was this ideology that led to Fender's guitars becoming the most popular, reliable and recognisable guitars in the world. Fender made the electric guitar more affordable, reliable and most importantly, made it more available to the public. Fender again revolutionised the design of the electric guitar with the introduction of the "Stratocaster" model in 1954. The Stratocaster is, without question, the most recognisable guitar in the world, played by everyone from Eric Clapton to John Mayer. Eric Clapton himself said "Leo Fender was so far in advance of anybody else, developing the Strat to the point where it just can’t be bettered, even now. My hat’s off to him." </p>
        <h2>Les Paul</h2>

        <p>Les Paul was a musician and inventor who is largely associated with the Gibson Les Paul model which bears his namesake. While he was a popular musician in the 1930s and 40's, he was also constantly tinkering with guitars, and more so the recently developed electric guitar, constantly trying ways to customise and improve the design. Les Paul struck gold with the "Log" in 1941. Although it was essentially just a plank with strings and pickups, it produced a unique and pleasant sound, and it was from here that Les continued his development of solid guitars. Eventually, in partnership with Gibson, Les helped to design the Gibson Les Paul model, which is another iconic guitar used by countless artists. </p>
